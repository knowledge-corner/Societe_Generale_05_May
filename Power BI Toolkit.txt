Report View
-------------------------------------------------
1. Get Data - connect to data
2. PQE - Transform Tab, Report View, Table View, Model View
3. Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Line Chart
4. Types of Filters - Drill down/up, Edit Interactions between charts, Filter Pane (filter on visual, page, all pages), Slicer, Drill through filter 

5. Customise themes


-------------------------------------------------

Power Query Editor - 

- Use to clean and transform data
- Applied Steps - Keeps track of all the transformation steps applied to the data, data will pass through the steps on every refresh, keep them minimal to optimise the data refresh
- cltr + z does not work on PQE, modify the steps using Applied steps dialogue box
- Use first row as header
- Remove rows 
- Unpivot columns
- Advance Editor - M-code
- Column Profiling - View Tab > Column Profile - column statistics
- Append Queries - Union of Tables
- Connecting to Folder - combine and Transform - Automatically append all the files in the folder into a single table. Column headers for all the tables must be same
- Transform Tab vs Add Column Tab
- Text, Number and Date Transformations
- Enable load  - loads the query to power bi desktop
- include in report refresh - checks for updates in the data

- Append Queries - Same data or same column headers

- Merge Queries - Used when data about same entity is present in two tables


Invoices detail - 

Invoice# | Invoice Date | Vendor ID |  Bill Amount 


Vendor Details - 

Vendor ID | Vendor Name | GST No. | Register state | Contact …..


Types of Merge - 

1. Inner - Returns only the common rows wrt to reference column
2. Left  - 
3. Right - 
4. Full Outer - Returns all the rows and where the reference is not matching it will null

Vendor ID | Vendor Name | GST No. | Register state | Contact | Invoice# | Invoice Date | Vendor ID |  Bill Amount

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Model View

Data Modelling - allows us to connect table by relationships, and thus we can display data from different related table on a chart

- Relationships
- Cardinality
- Cross filter

Example on on-to-one relationship - 

Employee & Workstation Assignment
- Table 1: Employees → (Employee ID, Name, Department)
- Table 2: Workstations → (Workstation ID, Employee ID, Location)



-------------------------------------------------------------------

Table View 
- Column Tools - currency, %, decimals value, summarization, data groups


-------------------------------------------------------------------

DAX - Data Analysis Expression - Formula language in Power BI Desktop

Categorial Data or Dimension - Product, Date, Customer Name  - adds a filter or granularity to the measure

Measure - a metric, always aggregated Continuous (eg. temp, sales, profit etc) and Discrete (eg. Hot/cold, Profit/Loss, Heavy/Light)

New Measure - aggregate level calculation
	- Generate a formula evaluated on the visual

New Column - row level calculation
	- Generates new column with new data 
	- increasing the size of the dataset/ data model



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples - 

Ex. Example on cross filter direction wrt to slicer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ex. Calculate days required to ship the product and check if it is in-time or late delivery. Display the count of the number of in-time and late deliveries. Display as % of grand total
-- Create a column
-- Same day - 0
-- First - <= 2
-- Second - <= 4
-- Standard - <= 6

- Creating new column
- Datediff(), IF(), creating a variable using VAR and RETURN, && and || operators

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ex. Country Performance - A performing country is identified as total profits greater than 10,000. Highlight performing and non-performing countries on a map.
- Create a measure
- Conditional formatting on map
- Apply what-if parameter to dynamically change the Threshold

Ex. Count number of performing and non-performing countries
-- Create summarise Table

Ex. Create a field which calculates Target Profit Margin as 10% of Sales. Using a gauge chart and a slicer display sub-categories and their target status. Convert gauge chart to bullet chart. Use red-amber-green color coding to highlight.

Ex. calculate the total sales from customers younger than 45 years.

Sales_Under45 = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]),
    FILTER(
        Customers,
        Customers[Age] < 45
    )
)

Ex. Examples on Date Table
 - Create Date Table
 - Create FY- year, month, quater
 - sort by month_no
 - Active - Inactive relations and Userelationship function

Ex. Number of orders shipped by first class in 2020 – use relationship

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ex. Calculate MRP as Price * Quantity - 
Sol - Total Amount = Orders[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Price])
- PQE vs Column vs Measure

- Use PQE if the column is static and can be computed before loading.
- Use DAX if the column needs to be dynamic and interact with filters/slicers.


Ex. Top N filter from filters pane and Display top 3 countries by sales from each Market.

Ex. KPI, Decomposition Tree, 

Ex. Bookmarks - Save the filter and selections

Ex. Page Navigator


Ex. Row Level Security

What is RLS?
Row-Level Security (RLS) restricts data access for users based on filters defined in Power BI. It ensures that users only see the rows of data relevant to them.

Why Use RLS?
To protect sensitive or confidential data
To avoid creating separate reports for different users
To manage access efficiently and centrally


Ex. Workspace Roles







Goal - Multiply Quantity(Orders) and Price(Products)


- Tables are connected by relationship - create a measure and aggregate the two columns.  - Not Possible
- PQE - Add column - are limited to columns from same table, for column from different merge is required.  
- Add a column using DAX


- Adds a new column to data
- Processed when data is loaded, not dynamic

- Difference between Add column in PQE vs Add column in DAX - 
	- Perform row level calculation from related table in the data model. 


- Perform a row level calculation and then aggregate it on the visual - SumX(), AverageX(), MinX()…
